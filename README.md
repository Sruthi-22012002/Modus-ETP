## Infrastructure Design

**1. Load Balancing & Traffic Distribution**
 * Azure Front Door is used to globally load balance incoming traffic across multiple Azure regions. This ensures low-latency access for users regardless of their geographical location and improves fault tolerance by automatically routing traffic to healthy instances.
 * SSL termination is handled at the Front Door level to offload this task from the web app, improving performance.

**2. Scalable Web Hosting**
 * Azure App Service (Premium Plan) is used to host the web service. This plan provides auto-scaling based on metrics such as CPU and RPS (requests per second), allowing the application to scale horizontally as traffic increases.

 * Application slots (e.g., staging and production) enable Blue/Green deployments, reducing downtime and risk during deployment.

**3. Database Design**
 * Azure SQL Database is the core data storage solution, providing a managed, scalable relational database with built-in high availability features like geo-replication and automatic failover.
 * The database is optimized for high-performance workloads, and it scales to handle 1000 RPS without performance degradation.

**4. Security**
 * Azure Key Vault stores all sensitive data, including API keys and database connection strings, ensuring that they are never hardcoded into the application code.
 * Azure‚Äôs identity and access management services ensure that only authorized users and services can access sensitive resources.

**5. Monitoring & Alerting**
 * Azure Monitor provides real-time monitoring of application performance, availability, and infrastructure health.
 * Application Insights helps track application-specific metrics, such as response times and error rates, enabling quick diagnosis of issues.

## Deployment Plan
**1. CI/CD Pipeline**
 * GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines are used for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline automates the entire build, test, and deployment process, ensuring that changes are seamlessly deployed to the Azure environment.

**2. Auto-scaling**
 * Azure App Service automatically scales the application based on traffic patterns, utilizing Azure's built-in scaling capabilities.
 * Horizontal scaling (increasing the number of instances) is triggered by CPU utilization or RPS thresholds, ensuring that the web service can handle large volumes of traffic without compromising performance.

**3. Integration Testing**
 * All code changes are tested in a staging environment before being deployed to production. This ensures that no breaking changes reach the live environment.

## How it works

The system architecture is designed for efficiency, security, and scalability, capable of handling high volumes of traffic (1000 requests per second).
* **Frontend requests** are sent directly to the **Azure Web App**, which hosts the Node.js application. This service automatically scales to handle traffic spikes and ensures high availability.
* The web application communicates with a secure **Azure SQL Database** to perform transactional data operations, offering reliable data storage with built-in backups and redundancy.
* External services are integrated using RESTful APIs via Axios, allowing the application to fetch and process data from third-party systems in real time.
* Sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials are securely managed using Azure Key Vault, ensuring secrets are not exposed in code or version control.
* Monitoring and diagnostics are handled by **Azure Monitor and Application Insights**, offering deep visibility into application performance, request rates, error rates, and response times.

> This streamlined deployment model ensures secure secret handling, reliable external communication, and robust performance monitoring‚Äîall within a scalable Azure ecosystem.

## Getting Started
<b>Step 1</b>: The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:
 ```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/Sruthi-22012002/Modus-ETP.git sample-node

# Change directory
cd sample-node

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm start
 ```
**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon). It watches for any changes in your node.js app and automatically restarts the server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run `sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

**Step 2:** To get started with deploying a scalable web application on Azure, a cloud infrastructure capable of handling 1000 requests per second (RPS) with auto-scaling capabilities to ensure performance during traffic spikes. It leverages Azure SQL Database as a secure and scalable solution for managing relational data, supporting high throughput and geo-replication for resiliency. The web service is architected to be secure, monitored, and resilient to failures, with features like HTTPS, WAF, Application Insights, and automated alerts. It integrates seamlessly with external APIs, using Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials. Additionally, the project implements a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps to enable smooth deployment, version control, and zero-downtime releases, ensuring fast and reliable updates to the application.

## Live RPS test with confirmed 1000 RPS threshold

[Live RPS Test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yXPRcz_xBru8kLLDwVB2tmnO8_fXp2cP/view?usp=sharing)

## Limitation and challenges

Due to restrictions imposed by the current Azure subscription, certain services could not be activated or tested:
  * **External API Integration:** Subscription limits on resources prevented the deployment and testing of external API integrations using Azure App Service and Logic Apps. External API calls could not be made as a result.
  * **Azure Key Vault Setup:** The subscription also limited the provisioning of Key Vault resources, which hindered the secure storage of sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials.
Plan for Completion: Once these limitations are lifted, the integration and secure setup will proceed, utilizing managed identities and Azure AD for secure authentication.
## Conclusion
> This architecture is designed to provide a highly available, scalable, and secure web service that can handle 1000 RPS. The combination of Azure services, such as Azure Front Door, App Service, SQL Database, Key Vault, and Azure Monitor, ensures that the service meets the required performance, availability, and security standards. The CI/CD pipeline, Blue/Green deployments, and auto-scaling features ensure that the service is always up-to-date and can handle traffic spikes with minimal downtime.

**This solution is robust, fault-tolerant, and secure, making it ideal for mission-critical applications that require high availability and scalability.**
